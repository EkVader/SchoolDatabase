# Students_Database
This is my first little project with JavaScript with addition of Node.js, Mongoose, MongoDB and Express.
There are some things unfinished besides ugly styling.
On JavaScript site for now there is no validation for input data, please do not add text in inputs where you need to put a number, i'll fix that.

To run an app you need to have Node.js installed. Through your Command Prompt you need to go to a project directory and type "npm install" this will create node_modules folder with all 
all npm packages which are necessary for this app to run.

In the background you need to run MongoDB and MongoDB Shell
To do that you need to download MongoDB to your computer, then open PowerShell twice in the first window type "mongod" and in second "mongo" in this exact order.
Once you do that in CMD type: nodemon index.js

This app is running on localhost on port 8080 so after you run an app in CMD, type http://localhost:8080/students in browser, and from there
you should be able to move to subpages by clicking buttons and links.
